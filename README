Nova Echo Science & Industry

A work in progress single window application to display the status of in game science and industrial jobs.
At present it is currently not using the "Eve Online" by CCP Games API server for data, but will interpret a downloaded xml file from the industry jobs API.

I am using this project to help me learn wxPython and further my understanding of python, so there are bound to be mistakes/bugs.
