Nova Echo Science & Industry

A work in progress single window application to display the status of science and industrial jobs in the game "Eve Online" by CCP Games.
At present it is currently not using the CCP API server for data, but will interpret a downloaded xml file from the industry jobs API.

I am using this project to help me learn wxPython and further my understanding of python, so there are bound to be mistakes/bugs.
