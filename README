Nova Echo Science & Industry

A work in progress single window application to display the status of science and industrial jobs in the game "Eve Online" by CCP Games.
At present it is starting to take data from the CCP API server for data, but as I am still testing it is mostly still taking data from a downloaded xml file from the industry jobs API.
The application generates a set of local cache files within its directory to reduce network data.
I am using this project to help me learn wxPython and further my understanding of python, so there are bound to be mistakes/bugs.
